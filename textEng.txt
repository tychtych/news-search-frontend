    About the Developer
    Front-end Developer with experience building responsive websites and specializing in HTML5, SCSS, Vanilla JavaScript and frameworks Vue.js and React. I have hands-on experience with AWS services as I was migrating recently the current project from Inmotion to AWS! Now I am preparing to pass the Cloud Practitioner exam (yes, I had a great practice first before the exam itself ha-ha!)
           I really enjoy working both independently and within a team to deliver a quality product.
           Moreover, I keen on minimalistic and elegant design solutions for users - I study a lot of material on UI
